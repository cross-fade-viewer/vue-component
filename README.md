# vue-component
The Cross Fade Viewer Vue Component is an interactive image tool based on OpeseaDragon and [Vue](https://vuejs.org/), which allows users to choose images from a gallery and change their opacity in an overlayed view.

## Prerequisites for implementation
To be able to implement the component you need to have a [Vue](https://vuejs.org/)-Application set up, where you can import it.
This requires the [Vue.js](https://awesomejs.dev/for/vue/pkg/245043713989935618/) library as a dependency.
